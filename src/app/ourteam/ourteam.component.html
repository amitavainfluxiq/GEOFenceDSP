          <h3>About Brance Wages<span>OWNER / CO-CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER / CHAIRMAN</span></h3>
          <h4>GEO-AI</h4>
          <p>Is Brance Wages’ brain child, which came to fruition after years of successful work in real estate and other related industries. Brance is a rare personality and contributes greatly to GEO-AI with a very specialized body of experience. When you have been successful on the inside of the industry and have generated millions, there are always things that you bring the table that are impossible to gain from the outside. His contribution to the audience we aim to serve is invaluable</p>

          <h5>An honest, hardworking family man, Brance is the kind of person you want on your team. With his leading innovations, what you get now and what you can expect from his leadership will continue to build confidence and trust with where you spend your ad dollars.</h5>

          <p>Brance has a background in real estate. In fact he is a 3rd generation realtor who decided to make a name for himself. Brance has been self-employed since the age of 21 and continues to learn and grow with the changing of technology. After five years of being a successful business owner, Brance teamed up with Josh DeShong and Keller Williams to make some magic happened with their business. Within the first year of being with Josh and the Keller Williams Preston Road team, Brance won Rookie of the Year over <i>1200 other agents at the DPR office in 2014.</i> He was also recognized as #3 in Units. Brance was able to help take Josh Deshong’s <i>30-million-dollar company sky high, doubling that 30-million within the first year, and tripling that amount in year two. Brance won #2 in Gross commission two years in a row out of the DPR office.</i></p>
          <p>Brance was very focused on becoming a name that was well known among those working in real estate. He built his own companies and programs, with integrity and intelligence, that lead him to be more than just a realtor.</p>

      <mat-list-item class="col-12">
        <mat-card-title class="textwrapper">
          <p>While working for Phoenix Roofing as the National Operations Manager, Brance was able to increase growth percentage by 22%. It was after Hurricane Irma, during his time with Phoenix Roofing and using GEO-fencing, that Brance saw a golden, lucrative opportunity. Brance discovered that Phoenix Roofing was targeting every person that was in a single neighborhood, including those that were not affected by Hurricane Irma, and therefore wasting that advertisement. He unlocked the key to allow agencies to advertise to a specific consumer, located in a specific neighborhood, without targeting the neighborhood as an entirety. Brance had an idea that would make him a true DSP. He put his plan into motion and his dream turned reality with GEO-AI.</p>

          <h3>About David Montgomery<span>CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER</span></h3>
          <h4>Mr Montgomery</h4>
          <p>Has over 15 years of experience of building and optimizing ad exchanges, including building the Realtime optimization for Poindexter systems (aka as xplusone), the industry’s first behavioral ad network. This system was acquired by Rocket Fuel. Mr Montgomery’s own RTB stack is integrated with Google Adx in APAC. He was previously chief scientist at Brandscreen, where he built the real-time algorithms for optimizing over 150K bids per second across multiple exchanges, including Google ADX, OpenX, Facebook, Rubicon etc. </p>

          <h5>Currently, Mr Montgomery builds and architects DSP’s that need to scale up to serving over 100K bids per second across multiple data centers and multiple SSP’s.
          <b>Major core infrastructure built for Brandscreen - Chief Scientist (Sold to MediaMath, over 300mil)</b>
          </h5>

          <p>Mr. Montgomery prototyped the below but it was impossible to implement in production due to limited engineering infrastructure capabilities and resources. He leveraged Hadoop using the Map/Reduce, Hive framework, and Python with terabytes of data to create a globally optimal real- time bidding framework, using all open source tools designed to be implemented across hundreds of servers and cores continually, in a high-throughput and low-latency environment.</p>
